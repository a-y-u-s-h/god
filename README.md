## God

God is a bash tool. It's a collection of my scripts that do multiple things including scaffold an ideal (custom) project structure for me, along with some utility files and scripts that I almost always use when I work with that particular framework or language.

### What problem does this tool solve?

Are you a language fanatic? Do you want to learn as many languages as you can **and** be able to start projects in them whenever you want? 

Then you must be aware that as you learn more things about different language or tools in a language you usually find many different ways of starting projects *ideally* - which you definitely must not remember (because things like these change with time, and remembering is job of memory that computers already have!) 

So presenting you `god` - a common bash command to create apps. Components related to those apps, etc. so that you can avoid remembering stuff! You just have to iterate over basic templates till you find the right one for yourself and reuse it whenever you want.

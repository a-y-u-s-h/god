## God

God is a bash tool. It's a collection of my scripts that do multiple things including scaffold an ideal (custom) project structure for me, along with some utility files and scripts that I almost always use when I work with that particular framework or language.

### What problem does this tool solve?

Are you a language fanatic? Do you want to learn as many languages as you can **and** be able to start projects in them whenever you want? 

Then you must be aware that as you learn more things about different language or tools in a language you usually find many different ways of starting projects *ideally* - which you definitely must not remember (because things like these change with time, and remembering is job of memory that computers already have!) 

So presenting you `god` - an umbrella bash command to scaffold apps, update dependencies, run different kinds of projects without knowing language or project specific commands. You can also use it to scaffold out components related to those apps so that you can avoid remembering stuff!

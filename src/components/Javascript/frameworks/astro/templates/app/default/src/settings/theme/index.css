    These are our global styles. The root
    components have a hidden overflow so
    you need to make your components overflow
    on will. Ideally you should be using some
    library that supports theming and not rely
    on making CSS modules at all. But you do
    have an option to simply use CSS modules.

    We'll style html, body to occupy

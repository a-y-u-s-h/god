#  ======================================
#    This command is provided by Moralis.
#    You'll have to look into cloud functions
#    --> 'setting up your IDE' section while
#    looking into server settings on Moralis to
#    get the command below, in case you somehow
#    refresh the keys or something.
#  ======================================

  #  ======================================
  #    Enter appropriate information required
  #    by the next command (by looking at your
  #    moralis dashboard) so that we can
  #    watch the server, with a single npm script.
  #  ======================================

  #  ======================================
  #    Enter appropriate information required
  #    by the next command (by looking at your
  #    moralis dashboard) so that we can
  #    deploy the server, with a single npm script.
  #  ======================================

#  ======================================
#    This means that we want to run the
#    function that's passed as an argument
#    to the list. It's important to know
#    because the functions themselves can
#    recieve their name as first argument.

    This file stores all the state logic for the
    component. Sometimes the store may be present outside
    of this component, but most of the time it shouldn't.
    It assumes that you have unstated installed as a package.
    A store is simply an object that contains various data
    which is common, yet should be configurable throughout
    the usage of this component.
